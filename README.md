UrbanFurnish
Company is a national retail company specializing in the
distribution of furniture products across the United States With a wide
range of products spanning tables, chairs, bookcases, and home furnishings
the company serves both individual consumers and corporate clients
UrbanFurnish operates across multiple regions and relies on various
shipping modes to meet customer demands efficiently
As the company grows, so does the volume and complexity of its sales and
logistics data To stay competitive in a fast paced retail environment,
UrbanFurnish must track key performance indicators ( such as total
sales, shipping duration, and regional demand This is vital for strategic
decision-making and optimising both inventory and delivery operations.

Problem:
UrbanFurnish
faced difficulty in transforming its raw sales and shipping
data into actionable insights Without a unified view of sales
performance, shipping patterns, and customer segments, the
company risked missed revenue opportunities, inefficient supply
chain decisions, and delayed responses to market demands.
To address these challenges, UrbanFurnish employed the service of a data
scientist to create a centralized dashboard that provides a clear,
interactive summary of sales metrics, shipping modes, regional
performance, and year over year comparisons empowering teams
with the data clarity needed for smarter, faster decisions
